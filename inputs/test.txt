Hello everyone and welcome to this free theoretical training on Bitcoin. I'm Rogzy, and through the first 5 chapters and 21 posters that you will be able to admire, I will explain what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is very mysterious, there are a lot of preconceptions and debates about this new technology. It is both a monetary and technological revolution. I hope to answer as many of your questions as possible and teach you the basics and fundamentals of this technology. First, we will look at where Bitcoin comes from and especially its monetary aspect. Ultimately, what is money? We live in a world today described as fiat with the euro and the dollar, which are based on debt and the trust of the European Central Bank. Bitcoin breaks these norms by offering a decentralized currency, controlled by no one. Next, we will look at wallets. Finally, how to use Bitcoin? It seems digital, we can't touch it, we can't visualize it. I will try to demystify this and teach you concretely how to use it. In the third part, it will be much more technical. We will finally see who these famous miners are that use so much energy. We will look at the pollution it causes, we will look at a Bitcoin transaction, the nodes, and finally the launch of this protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, the famous anonymous creator. Then, I want to take you to the future. What will Bitcoin bring to the world? What is this hyperbitcoinization? How will the markets react to this new asset? How will the geopolitical aspect of our world have to adapt to an asset uncontrollable by any state? El Salvador has recently adopted it, so now Bitcoin is literally shaking up the political field. This is very important for your future and especially the future of your children. Speaking of the future, we will end this training on the Lightning Network, Bitcoin's layer 2. Bitcoin is slow, obsolete, outdated. It's only 100 transactions per second and it pollutes. In fact, it's because Bitcoin is designed this way, but we have developed a higher infrastructural layer called the Lightning Network. I will try to explain what it is, how it works, and the real use cases. Imagine, for example, being able to stream money, literally sending 0.001 cents to the other side of the world instantly every second. And this money will go directly from your pocket to the pocket, for example, of the African artist you appreciate the most. Throughout this training, each video will be accompanied by a poster created, in this case for Surfing Bitcoin, the French-speaking Bitcoin conference in Biarritz. You can find all the posters downloadable and in HD right after the video or for YouTube in the description. This can help you better appreciate the video, knowing, as you see, that the overlays will always be next to me during the video about those I talk about. I hope you will enjoy this training. A huge thank to all the people who have supported me for more than two years now so that I can continue to provide educational content for the general public, 100% free in French and in a good quality, let's say. I am quite proud of my posters, you will notice it through the trainings. I am Roxy, you will also have all the resources directly on the DécouvreBitcoin website or in the description or later on Teachable. You can go at your own pace, I think it will take several hours because indeed, discovering Bitcoin is not something magical. It's not magic money, it's not something that will make you rich overnight. Bitcoin is a real technological and monetary revolution. So, just as you had to learn to use the Internet, you will have to learn to use Bitcoin or learn to drive a car. It's a bit the same thing. I'll see you right away for chapter 1 on money and we'll start with the first lesson on, ultimately, what is money, where does money come from, what is the purpose and functioning of money in a society.
